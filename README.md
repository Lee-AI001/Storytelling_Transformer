## ✨ LanternAI — A ongoing project aim at improving Transformer's storytelling ability :) 

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to **LanternAI**, a storytelling transformer designed to generate consistent, genre-rich stories ✍️🌌  
You're looking at version **v2.5**, and it's still growing, so feel free to explore, try it out, or even join the journey! 😄

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

- 💡 A transformer model trained for narrative generation  
- 📦 Pretrained model + tokenizer (already saved in `storage/`)  
- 🧠 Modular files: easy to understand and extend  
- ✨ Plug-and-play `pulling.py` to load any model version you like!
